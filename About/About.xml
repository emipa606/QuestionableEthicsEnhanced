[h1]Changes to Questionable Ethics mechanics[/h1]

[list]
[*] The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2213696082]Life Support System[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1785162951]Crude Bionics[/url] have been moved to standalone mods, to improve mod compatibility.
[*]All descriptions have been re-written with an emphasis on [b]discoverability[/b] (how do I use this item and where do I obtain it) and [b]correct grammar[/b].
[*][b]Failed cloning no longer causes Cloning Vat ingredient loading to break[/b]. This was a high-impact bug in QE and many people asked for a fix.
[*]Nutrient Solution and Protein Mash recipes, output, and costs have been rebalanced across the board. See mod preview image for details.
[*]Cloning vats now display how many days remain until clone is fully grown, instead of a percentage of completion.
[*]The Apply Brain Templating toils have been re-written and many bugs have been fixed. Get [url=https://github.com/KongMD-Steam/QuestionableEthicsEnhanced/blob/master/Languages/English/Keyed/QuestionableEthics.xml]feedback messages during pawn selection[/url], if it's an invalid target.
[*]Family relationships will no longer be generated for clones
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod patches in changes to vanilla organ defs, but does not remove anything from the vanilla game. All defNames in the mod are unique and should not conflict with other mods. Any mods determined to be incompatible will throw a custom error message upon loading the game, when QEE and that mod are both enabled. [b]Consider this mod compatible with your modlist, unless specified below:[/b]

[b]Enhanced Functionality[/b]
[list]
[*]Bionic Icons - Textures from this mod will be used for the organs. Highly recommended upgrade over vanilla textures!
[*]Evolved Organs - Has exciting changes to its mechanics when QEE is enabled. There are too many to list, but [url=https://github.com/Xahkarias/Evolved-Organs/blob/master/About/Patch%20Notes.txt]go here[/url] for more details.
[*]Evolved Organs Redux - Has exciting changes to its mechanics when QEE is enabled. See [url=https://github.com/Xahkarias/EvolvedOrgansRedux/wiki/Compatibility#high-synergy]this link[/url] for more details.
[*]Race mods built with Humanoid Alien Races 2.0 - Races will be able to to be cloned in the Cloning Vat.
[*]Rah's Bionics and Surgery Expansion (RBSE)
[list]
[*]Organ installation requires RBSE research pre-req 'Organ Transplantation'
[*]Organs need to be refrigerated
[*]Organ Rejection hediff added when organs are implanted, if the RBSE ModSetting for this is enabled.
[/list]
[/list]

[b]Fully Compatible[/b]
[list]
[*]Android Tiers - TX Series
[*]Bioreactor
[*]Combat Extended - no patch required
[*]EPOE - Use the 'EPOE - Forked' version posted by Aurani, Victorique, and Tarojun, for best compatibility
[*]Harvest Organs Post-Mortem (HOPM) - All natural organs from QEE have a chance to spawn after autopsy
[*]LOTR races from Lord of the Rims by Jecrell (and the LOTR Continued mods by Mile)
[*]Pawnmorpher
[/list]

[b]Partially Incompatible[/b]
[list]
[*][Beta] METRO 2033 - Mutants - Custom AI code that will cause cloned animals to attack colonists or colony buildings
[*]Harvest Everything - A lot of duplicate functionality
[*]Hospitality - A Postfix from Hospitality can cause performance drain while organ and pawn vats are active/loading. The impact of this drain will be more noticeable with large modlists. To minimize the perf. drain, remove Bills from organ vats when done. The fix for this is non-trivial, but it's on the to-do list.
[*]Multiplayer - The multiplayer mode of the game will not work properly, but single player should work fine.
[*]Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids - Insects are technically cloneable, but the mod has custom AI code that will cause cloned insectoids to always go Manhunter after cloning.
[*]Warforged - Warforged pawns can't be cloned (they are robots that have no meat). See the GitHub issue for more details.
[/list]

[b]Incompatible[/b]

[*]Questionable Ethics
